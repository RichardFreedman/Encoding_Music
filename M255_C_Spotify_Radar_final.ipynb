    "# **Music Data Analysis: Spotify API with Pandas, Altair, and NetworkX**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates several ways to operate Spotify API using Spotipy â€“ a Python package designed to enable user-friendly (ish) interactions with Spotify's music metadata. In Part I of this notebook, we will use Spotipy and Pandas to **set up a DataFrame containing a collection of songs (tracks)** found by a playlist ID. Then, we will investigate ways to **visually represent and compare** this collection using Altair (Part II) and explore the basics of **network graph visualization** using Pyvis and NetworkX.\n",

    "### Brief Introduction: Spotify, APIs, Spotify API\n",
    "\n",
    "As many of you know, **Spotify** is a paid music streaming web application launched in 2006. The service has about 182 million subscribers and hosts more than 70 million tracks. In 2014, Spotify released **Spotify API**, a web-based interface that allows anyone with a Spotify account to search, analyze, and manipulate Spotify's music metadata. In short, **an API** is a piece of software that enables two or more programs to talk to each other. You can learn more about APIs [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API).\n",
    "\n",
    "Going through this notebook, you'll be able to request Spotify API access for your personal notebook and perform all sorts of analyses on the tracks, users, artists, albums, and playlists of your interest. While some of the material covered in this Notebook is very basic, some elements might seem quite puzzling. Please don't hesitate to reach out and ask questions.\n",

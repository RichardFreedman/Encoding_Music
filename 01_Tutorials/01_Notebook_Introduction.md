# Using Jupyter Notebooks and Pandas to Work with Data

## Introduction

**Jupyter Notebooks** allow anyone to run Python code in any browser, without the need to use the terminal or command line. The notebooks are saved with the `ipynb` extension. Notebooks are organized as 'cells', which can be commentary (static, written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)), or Python code (which produce dyanmic output).  

**Navigate between cells** with the arrow keys on your computer, or just click in the cell you want to edit or run. 

To **run an individual cell**, use the arrow/run command at the top of the Notebook, or just press Shift + Enter on your keyboard.

The **sequence in which cells have been run** is tracked in the space to left of individual cells.  The succession often matters, since one cell will use the state of a variable or dataframe that has been created in a previous one.  This is important, since it is possible to alter in a subsequent cell something that has been established in a previous one.

It is also good practice to **copy and rename** any notebook you work on in order to preserve the original version of it.

## Run the Notebooks in a Browser or VS Code

There are several ways to run, edit, and create notebooks. Students in Encoding Music can use the [Jupyter Hub](https://encodingmusic.haverford.edu/) created especially for this course. Log on with your full Haverford user id (including @haverford.edu and password--students from Bryn Mawr College will be given a special user account).  You *must* be on the Haverford College network, or VPN!

You can also run the Notebooks in a local installation of Jupyter or VS Code on your own computer.  See [this guide](https://github.com/RichardFreedman/Encoding_Music/blob/main/01_Tutorials/02_VS_Code_Google_Collab.md) to learn how.

## Where to Find the Notebooks

Class notebooks are published on the [Encoding Music Github](https://github.com/RichardFreedman/Encoding_Music) repository. 

If you plan to use the class [Jupyter Hub](https://encodingmusic.haverford.edu/) then there is an easy way to load the notebooks.  Follow the link--if you are already logged in to the Encoding Music Jupyter Hub, your notebooks will load (then log out and back in again!).  If you are not yet logged in to the Jupyter Hub, do so when prompted (and then log out and back in).

If you use Github you can "clone" the repository to your own space, then open the relevant folder of notebooks (a copy of which will now be on your own machine), and then navigate to them in the Encoding Music Juptyer Hub.  

If you are collaborating with a classmate, this might be the best way to share Notebooks and other code (with several branches on the same GitHub repository). Ask if you need help with this.


### Basic Navigation

If you're using the class Jupyter Hub, this is how you will open a notebook:

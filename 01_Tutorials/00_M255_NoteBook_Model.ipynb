    "# 1. Motivation \n",
    "\n",
    "The Beatles are my favorite band, and I know that their music underwent rapid and profound change during the 1960s.  The albums *Rubber Soul* (1965) and *Revolver* (1966) held pivotal places in this evolution, as Walter Everett explained in his excellent 1999 book, *The Beatles as Musicians:  Revolver to The Anthology*.  So I was interested to see whether this change was in any way evident in the kind of \"music feature\" data derived from the recordings themselves, in this case by Spotify.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Can we see any trends across the Beatles output based on the sound itself?  Can we find any albums that stand out from others?  And how would the evidence provided by Spotify's machine analysis tools align with my own impressions of the music, or Everett's?\n"

    "# 2. Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Prof. Freedman has conveniently assembled the Spotify data on all of the Beatles albumns as a single CSV file.  So this would be a simple starting place.  But since I am still a bit uncertain about the what Spotify's audio features are like, I thought the best first step would be to look at the columns in that data set and see which of them might be good candidates to tell me a bit more about the \"range\" of ratings for each.  If I am looking for change, then I need features (or combinations of features) that have the widest possibility for variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I looked at the columns as a list:  `beatles_spotify.columns`, which yielded (among the music feature categories) `['danceability', 'energy', 'speechiness','acousticness', 'liveness', 'valence']`.  Based on my exploration of the Spotify documentation and Nick Seaver's *Computing Taste Algorithms and the Makers of Music Recommendation*  I thought that 'danceability', 'energy', and 'acousticness' seemed the the categores most likely to reveal the trends I was interested in, particularly since (as I learned from Everett) the Beatles' recordings moved from a concert and dance music context to a contemplative, narrative and listening one. I guessed that I might see a decline in danceability over time and also a decline in acousticness (as more studio techniques came to the fore).\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the code cells below, I broke this down into several exploratory steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "2A.  I looked at the range of data for each audio feature, in this case by cutting the data for all tracks into 'bins' for each column using the Pandas 'cut' method.  There were some clear trends here, but since this was at the *track* level it was hard for me to say much about individual albumns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2B.  Then I came up with ways of aggregating the data for each album using Pandas `groupby` operations.  These are a bit tricky to understand, but using this I was easily able to say something about each.  The key think with `groupby` is to remember that you need to pass in a *list* of the columns, and then specify the function to apply to each of them (in this case:  `mean`.  Resetting the index gets the year and album names back in the dataframe and makes the whole easier to parse in subsequent steps.  The complete code is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grouped_data = beatles_spotify.groupby(['year', \"album\"])[['danceability', 'energy', 'acousticness']].mean()\n",
    "grouped_data = grouped_data.reset_index()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2C.  The resulting dataframe of results was hard for me to interpret, so I hit upon the idea of showing a kind of 'triple bar chart' for each album, with a consistent color for each feature. This was useful, since it allowed me to see what was distinctive about certain records as a whole.  *Rubber Soul* stood out on account of the *divergence* between the audio features (it hasd a much *lower* score for 'acousticness' in relation to the other features than any other album.\n",
    "\n",
    "2D.  This in turn prompted me to make a scatterplot for this album on its own and then to test those results against my own impressions and those of my authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commented code for each of these appears in the relevant cells below.\n",

    "# 3. Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "I was both surprised by and curious to explore the results.  Based on the audio feature data I selected, *Rubber Soul* is clearly an outlier among the other album on account of the very wide gulf between the mean 'danceability and energy' on one hand and the 'acousticness' on the other.  Of course we cannot be completely how the Spotify assigns a single value to a track (much less the 'mean' scores that I derived from those individual pieces). But the *differential* is nevertheless striking.  What might it mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "A low score in 'acousticness' might be another way of saying that these pieces are *more* electric, or at least more characterized by enriched timbres of the sort one could produce in the studio.  And indeed this is one of the important trends that marks the Beatles' development as musicians during this critical phase of their careers as a *studio* band.\n",
    "\n",
    "So with this insight in mind, I decided to look more closely at the data for individual songs in *Rubber Soul* and test these against my own impressions of the music (and against what Everett said).  What is fascinating to me is that many of the songs that are characterized by Spotify as 'low' in acousticness still involve a good deal of very conventional instruments, voices, and even volume.  They are nevertheless filled with blended voices, and very diverse timbres (sitar, pseudo harpsichord, echo effects, and so on).  This is very interesting, and as Everett notes, reflects the increasing concern of the Beatles to use the studio itself as a kind of instrument, quite apart from the actual instruments and voices involved in the songs!\n",

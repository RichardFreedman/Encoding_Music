    "Python is a powerful yet approachable programming language, making it ideal for use in this course. While Python has many applications, our focus in Encoding Music will be using Python to understand, transform, and create data related to music. The objective of this guide is to introduce you to the basic syntactical structure of Python while learning about four key topics:\n",

If you go to the earlier cell where we first assigned a value to `x` and change that value to `\"got it\"`, you have to **run that cell**. Only *then* can you return to the cell below, run it, and get the new output `\"got it\"`. This can become difficult to keep track of with larger files - if Python ever acts like code you wrote doesn't exist, first make sure you've run all the code you've written!"

    "Python is a powerful yet approachable programming language, making it ideal for use in this course. While Python has many applications, our focus in Encoding Music will be using Python to understand, transform, and create data related to music. The objective of this guide is to introduce you to the basic syntactical structure of Python while learning about four key topics:\n",

The main difference between `.py` files and Jupyter notebooks is the ability to break up code with sections of formatted text, called \"markdown\", easily run isolated sections of code, and view the the output of your code in one place.\n",

If you go to the earlier cell where we first assigned a value to `x` and change that value to `\"got it\"`, you have to **run that cell**. Only *then* can you return to the cell below, run it, and get the new output `\"got it\"`. This can become difficult to keep track of with larger files - if Python ever acts like code you wrote doesn't exist, first make sure you've run all the code you've written!"

    "### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the most important data types in Python. Here's a breakdown of what they mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "*(abbreviated `str`)* A **string** of alpha-numeric characters surrounded by quotation marks. The quotation marks can be double `\"text\"` or single `'text'`, but never mixed `\"not this!'`. We use strings for text, `\"anything from a long phrase or paragraph\"` to a single character `\"c\"`, or even an empty string `\"\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "*(abbreviated `int`)* A number that has no decimal or fractional part (e.g. `3`, `0`, `-10`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Floats\n",
    "\n",
    "A number that can have a decimal or fractional part, but doesn't have to (e.g. `3.14159`, `-7.2`, `5.0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "*(abbreviated `bool`)* A value that is either `True` or `False`, and must be capitalized exactly as shown. Booleans are written **without** quotation marks -- if quotation marks are included, Python will interpret the variable as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of values, written within brackets, and separated by commas. A list can contain any data type within it, and can contain multiple data types at once. A list can also contain another list (called a **nested list**).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `[\"John\", \"Paul\", \"George\", \"Ringo\"]`\n",
    "* `[\"Apple\", 2024, 0.8, [True, True, False]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do Data Types Matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with a variety of powerful functions that work with our data. But the way these functions work, and whether or not they work at all, depends on what data type Python thinks it's dealing with.\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious example is addition: writing `x = 5 + 5` will set `x` to `10`. However, writing `y = \"5\" + \"5\"` will set `y` to `\"55\"` - whats going on here? Try it out:"

There are various ways to see others:\n","\n","* **All rows**, set `pandas.set_option('display.max_rows', None)` or `pd.options.display.max_rows = 9999` before you display the frame.\n","* **Head** rows (default of five from the start, but can be any number):  `beatles_spotify.head(20)`\n","* **Tail** rows (default of five from the end, but can be any number):  `beatles_spotify.tail(20)`\n","* **Sample** a random sampling of x rows:  `beatles_spotify.sample(20)`\n","\n","\n","#### Selecting Rows:  `loc` and `iloc`\n","\n","* **iloc** to select rows by **index number** (the left-hand column) use `iloc`. The syntax puts rows before columns, as in `beatles_spotify.iloc[startrow:endrow, startcolumn:endcolumn]`.  Thus rows 10-15 (and all columns) of our dataframe would be `beatles_spotify.iloc[10:15, :]`.  Note:  the first number is *inclusive* but the second is *exclusive*.  So `10:15` will yield rows 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, but *not* 15.\n","* **loc** to select rows by **label** of the left-hand column (as when you might have an index of strings), use `loc`.  This is useful when our index is a string rather than a number.  It is especially useful for working with columns.\n","\n","Pandas Cheat Sheet:

See more [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_cleaning.asp).\n","\n","\n","\n","**The NaN Problem**. In Python there is a difference between a \"0\" and nothing.  The latter is a Null, which represents \"no data at all.\"  Nulls will result in errors when you attempt to perform some operation on them.  You cannot add to or compare something to a Null.  Nor can you test whether a Null contains some set of characters or matches a word. \n","\n","* **Find the NaN's**:  `df[df.isna().any(axis=1)]`, or for the billboard data:  `beatles_billboard[beatles_billboard.isna().any(axis=1)]`.  \n","\n","* **Fill the NaN's**. If you are performing mathematical operations, You can fill missing values with some default number or string. The solution will probably vary from one column to the next (since some are integers, some dates, and are text):  `beatles_billboard.fillna(\"-\")` would fill *all NaN* with the same string.  But we could instead try something that would be more meaningful.  For example: `beatles_billboard['Album.debut'].fillna(\"unreleased\", inplace=True)`\n","* If you are trying to filter a data frame by a particular keyword or condition, you can treat the Nulls as \"False\" and thereby ignore them.\n","\n","**Duplicate rows** can also create errors, or distort your results.  Find them:  `duplicate = beatles_billboard[beatles_billboard.duplicated()]\n","duplicate` (in this case there are none).  Remove them automatically with `beatles.drop_duplicates()`\n","\n","**Wrong Data Type** in a given column is another common error (particularly since Pandas attempts to guess the correct data type when importing from CSV or JSON).  In our beatles_spotify dataset, notice that the data type for 'energy' is `object`, which in the context of Pandas means it is a Python `string`.  As such we cannot perform mathematical operations on it. Change the data type with the `astype()` method:\n","\n","```\n","beatles_spotify['energy'] = beatles_spotify['energy'].astype(np.float64)\n","```\n","\n","The same thing can happen with **date=time** information.  In our orignal datasets, the \"Year\" columms are in fact integers.  This works fine for basic sorting.  But Pandas has an intelligent format for working with date-time information that allows us to sort by month-day-year, or create 'bins' representing quarters, decades, centuries.  \n","\n","So you will need to check the original data type, then convert to strings before converting to date-time format.  For example:\n","\n","```\n","\n","beatles_billboard[\"Year\"] = beatles_billboard[\"Year\"].astype(str)\n","\n","```\n","\n","Then convert that string to datetime format (in this case, in a new column, for comparison):\n","\n","```\n","beatles_billboard[\"Year_DT\"] = pd.to_datetime(beatles_billboard[\"Year\"], format='%Y')\n","```\n","And then reorder the columns for clarity:\n","\n","```\n","beatles_billboard_sorted = beatles_billboard.iloc[:, [0, 1, 9, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]]\n","beatles_billboard_sorted.head()\n","\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Wrong or Inconsistent Format** as when spelling or capitalization are different for the same item across many rows or columns.  There are Pandas methods to help with this process. \n","\n","\n","**Incorrect Data**.  This is more difficult, since you will need to know the details of the errors, and how to correct them.

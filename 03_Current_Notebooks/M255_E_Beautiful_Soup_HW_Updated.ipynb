    "In this homework assignment, you will get an opportunity to engage, explore, and experiment with **XML** files through Python and **Beautiful Soup**. As mentioned in class, **XML** stands for **eXtensible Markup Language** and mainly serves to transport and store data. At its core, XML was designed to be **both machine- and human-readable**. In the case of music files, the common encoding standard is **MEI**, which stands for **Music Encoding Initiative** and is built on top of the XML framework.\n",

    "* **access**: downloading, storing, reading, processing XML files\n",

    "* **interpretation**: exploring the meaning and utility of XML files from both analytical and creative perspectives \n",
    "\n",
    "As we deal with these files, we will make use of Beautiful Soup – a Python library that makes interacting with XML and HTML friendly and comfortable. Or at least tries to... You can access Beautiful Soup's documentation [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).\n",

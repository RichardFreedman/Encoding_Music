    "In this homework assignment, you will get an opportunity to engage, explore, and experiment with **XML** files through Python and **Beautiful Soup**. As mentioned in class, **XML** stands for **eXtensible Markup Language** and mainly serves to transport and store data. At its core, XML was designed to be **both machine- and human-readable**. In case of music files, the common encoding standard is **MEI**, which stands for **Music Encoding Initiative** and is built on top of the XML framework.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mainly, this homework focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **access**: downloading, storing, reading, processing XML files\n",
    "* **analysis**: performing basic quantitative and qualitative analysis of XML files\n",
    "* **interpretation**: exploring the meaning and utility of XML files from both analytical and creative perspective \n",
    "\n",
    "As we deal with these files, we will make use of a Beautiful Soup – a Python library that makes interacting with XML and HTML friendly and comfortable. Or at least tries to... You can access Beautiful Soup's documentation [here](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).\n",
    "\n",
    "XML files are guided by **markup rules**, which you can read more about [here](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_syntax.asp) and consist of **elements**, which you can dive into [here](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_elements.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "MEI files are primarily XML files that have music-specific sections, elements, and structure. You can learn more about MEI [here](https://music-encoding.org/).\n",
